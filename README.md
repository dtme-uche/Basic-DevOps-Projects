# Basic DevOps Projects
Welcome to the Basic DevOps Projects repository!

This repository serves as a comprehensive guide and documentation of my journey as I explore and experiment with various DevOps and cloud technologies. The primary goal is to solidify my understanding through practical projects while creating a resource that others can follow to gain a basic understanding of DevOps tasks.

## Structure of the Repository
Each project is organized into its own folder, which includes all the relevant files and resources. Additionally, every project folder contains a detailed README.md file that provides:

```
1. Project Overview: A brief introduction to the project, outlining the key objectives and the technologies used.
2. Setup Instructions: Step-by-step guidance on how to set up the environment and prerequisites needed to replicate the project.
3. Execution Details: Detailed instructions on how to execute the project, including code snippets, commands, and configuration files where necessary.
4. Learning Outcomes: A summary of the key learnings and insights gained from completing the project.
5. References: Links to any additional resources or documentation that were helpful in completing the project.
```
